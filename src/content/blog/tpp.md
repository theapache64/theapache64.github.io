I don't read much, and I want to change that. I've read a couple of books, but it took me longer than it should have. I guess I'm a slow reader, and I prefer to think about what I read instead of skimming.

Iâ€™m starting a reading log for `The Pragmatic Programmer`. It has 53 topics, and I plan to read at least 2 topics a day, which will take about 26 days! ðŸ¥´

## Day 1 (Jan 27)
- **Foreword and Preface:** This part shows how the book's content is simple and timeless compared to other tech books. It highlights how intimidating other books can be and emphasizes the importance of simplicity, which is key to this book. Also, the chapters can be read in any order since they're independent.

> Tip 1 : Care About Your Craft
> Tip 2 : Think About Your Work

- **It's Your Life:** People are complaining about issues at work but not taking action to fix them. This includes every complaint from developers. The goal is to take action until the problem is solved.
> Tip 3: You Have Agency

- **The Cat Ate My Source Code:** Things can go wrong. Instead of blaming someone, focus on finding a solution. This chapter emphasizes the value of ownership as well.

> Tip 4 : Provide Options, Don't Make Lame Excuses

## Day 2 (Jan 28)

- **Stone Soup and Boiled Frogs:**

## Day 3 (Jan 29)
- **Good-Enough Sofware:** 
- **Your Knowledge Portfolio:**
