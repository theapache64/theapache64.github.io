I don't read much, and I want to change that. I've read a couple of books, but it took me longer than it should have. I guess I'm a slow reader, and I prefer to think about what I read instead of skimming.

Iâ€™m starting a reading log for `The Pragmatic Programmer`. It has 53 topics, and I plan to read at least 2 topics a day, which will take about 26 days! ðŸ¥´

## Day 1 : Chapter 1 (Jan 27)

- **Foreword and Preface:** This part shows how the book's content is simple and timeless compared to other tech books. It highlights how intimidating other books can be and emphasizes the importance of simplicity, which is key to this book. Also, the chapters can be read in any order since they're independent.

> Tip 1: Care About Your Craft
> Tip 2: Think About Your Work

- **[It's Your Life](https://x.com/TlogOfTheDay/status/1884345281199890680):** People are complaining about issues at work but not taking action to fix them. This includes every complaint from developers. The goal is to take action until the problem is solved.

  > Tip 3: You Have Agency

- **[The Cat Ate My Source Code](https://x.com/TlogOfTheDay/status/1884697560687784340):** Things can go wrong. Instead of blaming someone, focus on finding a solution. This chapter emphasizes the value of ownership as well.

> Tip 4: Provide Options, Don't Make Lame Excuses

## Day 2 (Jan 28)

- **[Software Entropy](https://x.com/TlogOfTheDay/status/1889408618279346401):** This chapter explains how tech debt originates, its impact on projects, and how to manage it. It uses a "broken window" analogy for real-world relatability. The key takeaway is to prevent tech debt and maintain clear actions items for existing tech debts.

> Tip 5: Don't Live with Broken Windows

- **[Stone Soup and Boiled Frogs](https://x.com/TlogOfTheDay/status/1891191104139083849):** This chapter covers building something step by step and how to creatively persuade others to help you without causing resentment towards you or the project.

> Tip 6: Be a Catalyst for Change
> Tip 7: Remember the Big Picture

## Day 3 (Jan 29)

- **[Good-Enough Sofware](https://x.com/TlogOfTheDay/status/1891194941814026366):**
  - First version of any system should only be "good enough" and shouldn't be the best
  - Know when to improve and when to stop
  - Set tight scope for each version
  - Ship as early as possible to get early feedback

> Tip 8: Make Quality a Requirements Issue

- **Your Knowledge Portfolio [1](https://x.com/TlogOfTheDay/status/1891393142823477465)[2](https://x.com/TlogOfTheDay/status/1891499846236008846):**
  - Develop a habit of learning different new things
  - Participate in local groups and meetups and understand what others are working
  - Read a book a month
  - Think critically (5 whys method)

> Tip 9 : Invest Regularly in Your Knowledge Portfolio
> Tip 10: Critically Analyze What You Read and Hear
> Failed to maintain consistency. Restarting on Feb 12

## Day 4 (Feb 11)

- **Communicate [1](https://x.com/TlogOfTheDay/status/1891760564432498910)[2](https://x.com/TlogOfTheDay/status/1891867015729774684):**
  - Communication is equally important as your idea or work
  - Filter and convert your conversation based on your audience
  - Write an outline first before writing anything
  - Ask if its a good time before throwing a new idea at someone
  - Value the presentation style and model
  - Provide early drafts for early feedback
  - Listen, even if you already know
  - Documentation is an intergral part of a good system

> Tip 11: English is Just Another Programming Language

> Tip 12: It's Both What You Say and the Way You Say It

> Tip 13: Build Documentation In, Don't Bolt It On

> This chapter was longer. Hence only one topic

## Day 5 : Chapter 2 (Feb 17)

- **[The Essence of Good Design](https://x.com/TlogOfTheDay/status/1892046451204579542):**
  - ETC (Easy to Change) is the base of all design principle
  - Well designed code basically means easy to change code
  - ETC is value, that guides you to choose the right path for your code
  - Always ask yourself the ETC value of the code you just wrote
  - Try to make what you write replaceable. If not sure, add placeholder tag for future

> Tip 14: Good Design is Easier to Change Than Bad Design

## Day 6 (Feb 18)

- **DRY : The Evils of Duplication[1](https://x.com/TlogOfTheDay/status/1892404809141252222)[2](https://x.com/TlogOfTheDay/status/1894594991441207634)[3](https://x.com/TlogOfTheDay/status/1894958385113768013)**
  - DRY is not just about copy paste of code, rather duplication of knowledge. This include duplication in different way and in code comments as well.
  - Method/function documentation should be minimised and the code should be the documentation
  - Code duplciatation is okay in some case where it has different meaning at functional level
  - DRY violation in data shouldn't be exposed and should be mitigated with in the entity (or class)
  - Socialise common utilities where people will find it easy to reuse rather than creating their own version

> Tip 15: Don't Repeat Yourself
> Tip 16: Make It Easy to Reuse

## Day 7 (Feb 27)

- **Orthogonality[1](https://x.com/TlogOfTheDay/status/1895402562154573957)[2](https://x.com/TlogOfTheDay/status/1895728459361423786)**
  - Orthogonal systems = easy to design, build, test and extend
  - Independent systems where one's change doesn't affect the other
  - Layered orthogonal systems are much easier to maintain due to the abstraction
  - Careful when introducing a library that imposes changes in your code
  - Write shy code - modules that don't reveal unneccesary thing about them and don't rely on other modules
  - Avoid global data
  - Writing test is itself is a test to check your code is orthogonal or not
  - When writing documentation, don't worry about style. Use something like Markdown
  - Combining DRY + Orthogonal code produces flexible systems

> Tip 17: Eliminate Effects Between Unrelated Things

## Day 8 (Mar 3)

- **[Reversibility](https://x.com/TlogOfTheDay/status/1896417081203343627)**
  - Requirements and users change before you finish the code
  - Abstract your 3P integration code in a way that the 3P can be replaced easily with another one without changing any other Layered

> Tip 18: There Are No Final Decisions

> Tip 19: Forgo Following Fads!

## Day 9 (Apr 20)

- **Tracer Bullets**
  - Tracer Bullet Development is a way of building things with immediate feedback under actual conditions. During this time the goal may keep moving based on user feedback
  - End to end flow is covered, but only the essential blocks are built and mostly areas unknown and base to the product
  - Advantages:
    - Early feedback from users
    - Real world environment ready from day 1
    - Faster feedback for developers (faster debugging and testing because you're in real world env)
    - Up to date demo
    - Better feel and sense of progress since each update solves a usecase
    - Tracer code != prototyping because code is not thrown away, but being built up on

> Tip 20: Use Tracer Bullets to Find the Target

## Day 10 (Apr 21)

- **Prototypes and Post-it Notes**
  - Prototypes are used to analyse and expose risk.
  - They could be on a whiteboard, paper, mock up or even in code.
  - Correctness, completeness, robustness and style should NOT be part of the prototype
  - They are disposable and should be cheap to develop
  - Prototyping gives you an environment to experiment and expose risk. This is often is a learning experience.

> Tip 21: Prototype to Learn

## Day 11 (June 17)

- **Domain Languages**

  - Don't use a programming jargons to communicate
  - Use a language that's known to both the engineers and the domain experts
  - Use domain specific abstractions to make the code more readable to domain experts

> Tip 22: Program Close to the Problem Domain

- **Estimating**
  - Estimation is difficult and can't be accurate and constant
  - The easiest way to find an estimate is to ask the person who have already done it
  - Before giving an estimate, make sure you scope each part or phase of the project
  - Provide range rather than an accurate date, iterate on the date as you move
  - When estimate goes wrong, do a retro and learn! (this is a must)

> Tip 23: Estimate to avoid surprises
> Tip 24: Iterate the Schedule with the Code

## Day 12 : Chapter 3 - The Basic Tools (August 3)

- **The Power of Plain Text**
  - Plain text is understandable text to humans. That includes formats like HTML, JSON, YAML etc
  - Plain text will outlive all other formats
   - Consider how Unix is designed where most of the tools are simple, small, and sharp tools made for plain text. Eg: `grep` which can be used in conjunction with any other CLI tool

> Tip 25: Keep Knowledge in Plain Text

- **Shell Games**
  - Using a GUI for everything is not ideal, as certain tasks can't be automated or moded and will remain manual forever
  - Gain famility with the shell (use tools like `grep, sed, sort etc`)
  - Setup aliases and shell functions

> Tip 26: Use the Power of Command Shells

- **Power Editing**
  - Learn to use keyboard for all kind of text manipulation and code manipulation
  - Learn to navigate to code blocks using keyboard shortcuts
  - Try ditch the mouse and do everything using keyboard, especially in the IDE.
  - Building missing shortcuts as plugins and publish for others

> Tip 27: Achieve Editor Fluency

- **Version Control**
  - Its more than a "giant undo key"
  - Use version control for everything (including non code stuff)
  - Try backup your laptop using version control (so that you can easily recover)
  - Branching helps create isolated islands for you and your teammates to work without conflicting each others change

> Tip 28: Always Use Version Control

## Day 12 (August 4)

- **Debugging**
  - No software is free of bugs. So debugging takes major portion of your day
  - Sensitive emotional subject; Often you'd encouter denial, finger pointing, etc
  - Stop blaming. Start fixing.
  - Debugging mindset = turn off all your defenses that protects your ego and get ready to get surprised
  - Look at the symptoms and figure out the root cause. Don't fix symptomps. Fix root cause.
  - Starting point: Buildable code
  - Then Reproduce the bug with single command with the help of automated test, and not manually
  - Learn to use the IDE debugger and callstack analysis
  - Use BINARY CHOP! (Simple, Clever and Important!) (aka. divide and conquer). Maybe automate it too ?
  - Do caveman debugging to log previous states of the program. Use regular format as well (like your `QuickTag`) for eaiser filtering.
  - Rubber Ducking : Explain the bug to a dumb duck to listen to yourself while doing that. More likely you'll figure out the issue or get new insight when you do that.
  - Always suspect the application code and not the OS, 3P framework or any other external factor. 
  - Retro: 
    - Why didn't caught earlier? need unit test update
    - Bad data? Add better parameter checking
    - Any other places? Fix them
    - Took long time to fix the bug? Make a log file analyzer tool maybe? 
  
> Tip 29: Fix the Problem, Not the Blame
> Tip 30: Don't Panic
> Tip 31: Failing Test Before Fixing Code
> Tip 32: Read the Damn Error Message
> Tip 33: "select" Isn't Broken
> Tip 34: Don't Assume It - Prove It

## Day 13 (August 5)

- **Text Manipulation**
  - Tools like `sed` and `awk` can help implement text manipulation task way faster (than writing with a programming language)
  - Its difficult master, but going to be incredibly useful

- **Engineering Daybook**
  - Keep a tiny notebook and a pen with you at all times.
  - Note down things ideas and scribbles
  - When we start to write something, the brain switches the gear to a "rubber duck" mode
  - When a book is finished, save this one and get a new one, and continue
